#### prologue
A few months ago I started feeling pain in my wrists, AKA [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome).

Also - It came out that, while I'm working daily as a programmed for almost 25 years now, I'm relatively a slow-typer.

I made some internet research and eventually decided to switch from zero to a minimal split-mechanical-keyboard.

The purpose of this blogpost is to describe the jurney I did. hopefully someone else will will find this beneficial

#### split mechanical keyboards
So what's this all about, you ask?
Good question, basically it's keyboards that has two parts, one for each hand. for example here's the [ZSA moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) - a famous example

### why?
Split keyboards are presumably ergonomically better for your wrists as they enable a more natural posture for your hands and back. Their other premise is to enable faster typing when getting used to, especially when a the keybord has a minimal form.
This is somehow counter-intuitive: one may think that moew keys on your keyboard enable faster typing but in reallity bigger keyboards force you to make arm movements to get to the non-center keys

### switches and keycaps


#### two major categories of split mechanical keyboards
When getting into the world of split mechanical keyboard one may feel a little overwhelmed: there are far too many such keyboards for one to make a good choice. I'd like, therefore, I'd like to make a clear distinction:

- commercial keyboards
- hobbyist keyboards

##### commercial keyboards:
- [zsa moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) 
- [zsa voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) 
- [zsa EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) 
- [Keychron Q11](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard)
- [moErgo 80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards)
- [dacty](https://bastardkb.com/dactyls/)
- [charrybdis](https://bastardkb.com/charybdis/)
- [dygma raise2](https://dygma.com/products/dygma-raise-2)
- [dygma defy](https://dygma.com/pages/defy) 

All these modls are solid-yet pricey choices that each comes with its own pros and cons

##### hobbyist keyboards:
as it often happens with open-source - there are far too many kyboards to
